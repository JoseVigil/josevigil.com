# [How I Got Started](#how-i-got-sstarted)
### [with Design & Art](#with-design-art)

<br/>

Design and especially art is possibly what comes most naturally to me. I consider myself a born artist with enormous curiosity and learning ability whose passion is to create things that can solve problems or improve people's lives through disruptive technological business models. Nothing simple but super fun and entertaining. Without a doubt, art is something that I will practice in the future, however, while I pursue my mission, I will work in design, development and entrepreneurship. A vast field to be creative. My history with design dates back to my teens, with a few fringes of art happily dotting my life.

<br/>

### [Beginnings in Design](#beginnings-in-design)

<br/>

During my last year at height school I took vocational test. The result was Industrial Design. By then it was a very modern type of architecture and a futurist and fit very well into what was evident in me, an inmense universe of creativuty that it was aovbious I was capable of giving to the world. My syster Caro studied architecture at <a href="https://www.fadu.uba.ar/" target="_blank">FADU</a> UBA (Universidad de Buenos Aires) and I was encourage to go to the same on. Ny father was not that happy unfortunately however I moved forward.

<br/>

### [Industrial Designer](#industrial-designer)

<br/>

I have not had a professional career as a classic Industrial Designer. My path was marked by technology and digital design from the very beginning. So much so that I sustained my studies working in the IT sector. In this way I support my studies ...<a href="/started/technology#supported-university" target="_blank">Supported University</a>.

<br/>

My professional carrer as an Industrial Designer has not

I worked on many designs within the project and conceptual framework of industrial design, however few projects that marked my future and <a href="/started/technology#vocation" target="_balnk">vocation</a>.

##### [El Server](#el-server)

<br/>

In 2007 I really enjoyed working on the design of a server computer for the company <a href="https://elserver.com" target="_balnk">El Server</a> (web hosting) where your logo is materialized on a server with personality that shows the brand attributes. It was super interesting for me since joined my two passions: technology and design.

### [Artist Traits](#artist-traits)

<br/>

#### [Painting Award](#painting-award)

<br/>

<JDate data={frontmatter.dates['Buenos Aires No Duerme']}/> I participated in a drawing contest and to my surprise I won it. I had allways had great skills for art, drawing, plastic music. However it was never profitable, except for once.

<br/>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <JImage src="/images/started/design/design_buenos_aires_no_duerme.png" width="374px" height="408px"></JImage>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p style="width: 300px; padding-left: 10px;"> I had a strong message to be an artisti. I was always very creative, I could have been an artist and I had some indications to do it. I remember that in 1998 I was participating in the assembly of an Industrial Design stand for the <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/comenzo-buenos-aires-no-duerme-98-nid104473/" target="_blank">Buenos Aires No Duerme</a> festival working for my friend <b>Micaela Saconni</b> when I decided to participate in a painting contest organized by Levi to paint pants whose prize was a trip to the USA and clothes. I remember I was badly asleep because of the deliveries of the faculty, stressed and tired. I decided to participate and I painted a light brown background and some plants with flowers. I finished and went to sleep üò¥.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

I woke up with a call telling me that I had <b>won the contest</b> üèÜ. I was surprised. I really was not expecting to win. I gave clothes to my friends and did not use the ticket unfortunately. Today I think that I could have gone to study arts, life showed me another path, I will have time to make art in the future. I can be an artist after I fulfill my dreams.

<br/>

#### [Cartoons Sketches](#cartoons-sketches)

<br/>

<JDate data={frontmatter.dates['Cartoons']}/> Stated sketching. As a child I had drawing skills and at an early age my drawings had meaning and expression. Drawing helped me a lot to develop my career as an Industrial Designer and at some point I also dreamed of being able to create my own characters and cartoons or movies. I found very inspiring and creative drawing sketeches in hardcover accounting book with numbered white pages where I scribbled shapes and gave them a character and expression through drawing.

<br/>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <JImage src="/images/started/design/design_dibujos_copiador.png" width="175px"></JImage>
        </td>
        <td>
          <JImage src="/images/started/design/design_dibujos.png" width="300px" pl="10"></JImage>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p style="width: 270px; padding-left: 10px;">I developed a drawing system where I would draw some lines on the paper and imagine a character or an object or shape and then redefine it with shadows and contrasts. This led me to find and invent characters that, when I have the resources, I can bring to life through one or more scripts. I think there is a fantastic world to explore in this book. A treasure for me üßà.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

In this imaginary universe full of life and personal objects, environments, aliens and animals, there are stories that cross imaginary worlds that want to be told. Sometimes the most irrelevant and hidden curves can create the best characters, with greater expression and life of their own. These are some who can start telling their stories.
