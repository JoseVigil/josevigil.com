# PadKite

My first entrepreneur project was an incredible demonstration that any problem has a solution. It
was around early 2007 before the iPhone was launched and Android was in version 2.1 that even
early adopters complained that touch screen cellphones were too tiny to use it with big fingers.
There was so much enthusiasm with mobile that I decided to do something about it.
Created my first LLC in the US and assembled an international team of outstanding people who
shared my vision and we build an incredible piece of software.
PadKite, was the name given to the first mobile cursor for Android that operated over a web
browser with the use of gestures. It was the mouse of touch screen and its performance was
incredible. Even got a great hype after I posted a thread at Hacker News, the best technology forum
for entrepreneurs in the US. The post was at the top of the day during one day and generated 20.000
downloads. This fact gave me great encouragement to move ahead with my career as an
entrepreneur and marked me for the rest of my career. Everything is possible if you are committed.
