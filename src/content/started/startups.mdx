# How I Got Started
## with Startups

I must say that the way of life and the meaning of life of running a startup began at home. My father, an electic engineer, has been able to build engineering companies for the countryside and at home there was always an air of entrepreneurship. Since I was a child and during my <a href="/started/technology#childhood" target="_target">childhood</a> I was also surrounded by a technological environment that without realizing it absorbed. However, I don't do what I do to prove anything to anyone but because of my personality.

<br />

##### Stubborn and reckless personality

I consider myself as:

<br />

##### 1. The Boss
No boss, I am the boss. I make the desitions and accept the concecuences. My complete lack of ability to work with a boss has been crusial. I do not recognize anyone above me except for rare exceptions where I find myself working with extraordinary people whom I respect and admire. The world is full of useless and manipulative know-it-alls that I will never ever recognize., only as customers or clients ‚≠ê.

<br />

##### 2. Very Creative
Sometimes at unimaginable levels my head is constantly living with new creative ideas and everything I do in my productive life is driven by my creativity. This comes naturally in many things I can do. Statups are indeed a very creative field of interaction therefore my choice in life.

<br />

##### 3. Intuitive
I handle myself with intuition and it is a type of intelligence that also comes out to me. When I meet a person or when I have to forecast a business, I use my intuition and I find it very efficient. This point is also very important when making decisions.

<br />

##### 4. Curious Self Learner
My curiosity is to blame for having learned tons of technology, applicable or not, in a self-taught and independent way. When I'm passionate about something I'm curious and I learn it. It is very rare to find hands-on people in technology who, at my age, want to continue learning. Many hang up their gloves.

<br />

##### 4. Dreamer
I dream big, ambitious, wide dreams. I live every day my dream of creating my own projects, building my startups and I am happy being a dreamer. Being a dreamer has many side effects related to luck of reality, its something that has to be worked out. Thats all.

<br />

<b>I choose to work on my ideas and ideals. They are not negotiable.</b>
After so many years doing it, it is my way of life, my way of being in the world. Added to who I am, I wake up believing in it and I want to die doing this. However, one does not get to have that determination because yes, it is built based on convictions and dreams. I've had some hints that paved the way to startups.

### [Clues and Signs](#clues-and-signs)

It was 1996, I was 21. I had an idea for a children's toothbrush kit for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/346921Z:US" target="_target">Zooth Inc</a> that designs and distributes children's toothbrushes and toothpaste. The project consisted on two different holders with glasses, one was modular for multiple usage and the other one was individual where both came with character stickers to be placed on them by the users. They where fixed to the wall with an adhesive placed on their back.

<br/>

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

I designed it, I modeled it and I made a very well presented model. I also built te plans and presentations for the company in the United States. All on my own. Manufacturing sudies took place in China. The kit was patented in Argentina, however the project did nottake over. It was very expensive to manufacture, the molds very complex, and too expensive for a toothbrush. However the idea good.

<br/>

However my first real indicator about creating digital products came <b>accidentally</b> and almost without realizing it. As an Industrial Designer student I was convinces I would design and develop physicall producta. However my first product was digital, for the Internet and to my surprise highly demanded. It was based on dynamic charts, pies, bars and line type charts. The story goes like this.

<br/>

### [My First Product](#my-first-product)

Years later, around 2002 or so I started working at a local statup comapany in Buenos Aires called <i>Arinware Intelligent technologies S.A.</i> as a Flash AS2 Developer. The statups produced software for call centers and communication comanies. My firts task was to develop an <i>E-learning Tool</i> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaya" target="_blank">Avaya</a> with very sophisticated animations of phones displays for training custommers and personnel. By that time the company was facing financial problems and I have been asked to take a look at some charts that the <i>Technovoz</i> callcenter system was not able to run due to unpaid chats licences. Bare in mind chats by that time where very expensive. So with some preliminar calculation and a series of test scripts I was able to write -in Flash- a basic like chart that drew a random line over an x and y axis. It was weird and old fashion type of scripting since object oriented came to ActionScript afterwords in AS3 Version so I had to figure out how to solve it via synchronic code, and I did.

<br/>

I was nice. But nicer was after I got together with the .Net specialist Rodrigo Diaz and we started pushing dynamic data into it. It worked and was marvelous! The story is that I was able to develop all the suite charts including pie, bars and spider. I was amazed myself and helped the startup to avoid paying licences. However that was not what surprised me the most. It was that after I left that job I compiled all the charts and posted them on the internet on a page I used to show my work in interviews. I must have been two months after that when I was digging into the hosting server starts and found out the chats have been download used by southoands of people and all over the world.

<br/>

Unfortunately I did not undertand the meaning of that until years later. If I would I could probably not be even writting this post and enjoing my revenue like <a href="https://www.fusioncharts.com" targer="_blank">FusionCharts</a> who started at that time with similar technology as I accomplished with my very own hands. This experience opened my mind in the senso of showing me that I could build products and sell them over the Internet.

Over the yeards. The two most important things I have to be greatfull about is to continue building my experience while engaging with real people.
