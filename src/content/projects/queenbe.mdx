### [About](#about)

<br/>

QueenBe is a blockchain-based multi-service platform where you can interact with all kinds of tokens as a business or individual user.

Why QueenBe?

Like a Queen Bee that lays all the eggs and is the mother of all the bees in the beehive; QueenBe is capable to interact with all kinds of tokens as if it were a bee colony. Compatible with several hives (blockchains) such as Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, and more.

Each token starts being a little egg laid by QueenBe. The same will become in a bee larva and someday could BE a new queen bee if its popularity increases. Or only a workerâ€¦

You, as beekeeper, can explore, discover, and mint fungible and non-fungible tokens through QueenBe.
