## [About](#about)

Nenes is an Argentinian technology and startup community of around 60 young braves (August 2023) created as a re-brand of <a href="https://notimation.com" target="_blank">Notimation</a> company (founded in <a href="/projects/notimation#notimation-origin" target="_blank">2019</a>) plus crypto projects, including IoT. Those who belong to this community are called nenes wich in spanish means something like "babies". Specially in my county, that definicion "nene" in the slang is a way of saying that someone is big or very good as a joke. Further explanation about the name below.

<br />

To become a nene, you have to either study at our <a href="/projects/maular" target="_blank"> Maular School</a> or necome part of the community after showing special and outstanding features as a professional and person.

## [Smart Communications & Crypto](#communication-and-crypto)

The community basically works on projects that subscribe to communications, artificial intelligence and crypto. The community seeks the demonstration of business models spearheaded by these technologies on business segments such as companies (B2B). It is our ideal to be able to make use of our knowledge to find values in these niches and satisfy the needs and solve the problems of our clients. Of course, to demonstrate the models with business segments aspire to be able to provide service to end users (B2C).

## [Background](#background)

My serious work with young people is not new. During 15 years I leaded young developers plus an interesting experience in two schools as a <a href="/previous/gamves#computer-science-and-robotics-teacher" target="_blank">computer science and robotics teacher</a> during 2016 that provided me an accurate knowledge and undertanting of talented people.

<br />

However around May 2022 I was working at <a href="https://notimation.com" target="_blank">Notimation</a> as CEO since April 2021 where after changes in the strategy and team the company had to <a href="/projects/notimation#pivot-to-smart" target="_blank">pivot to smart</a>, compulsory. In a nutshell, the bulk SMS notification business was over and for movin forward the company would have to innovate. I took the challenge ðŸ’ª.

<br />

Pivoting, innovating and adding value to the core service is not an easy task and is only possible via development, smart development. I had only one developer, now out and I had to engineer. It was then when I started digging into <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josevigil/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.
