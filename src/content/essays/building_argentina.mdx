### [from Buenos Aires Argentina](#from-buenos-aires-argentina)

<br/>

<b>Economic and Political Instability</b>: Argentina has a history of economic volatility and political uncertainty, including high inflation rates, currency devaluations, and changing government policies, which create a less attractive and stable investment environment for traditional angel investors.

<br/>

<b>Limited Access to Capital</b>: Startups in Argentina often face challenges in accessing capital, as traditional angel investors tend to favor more stable investment opportunities, which can be relatively scarce in an unpredictable economic landscape.

<br/>

<b>High Risk</b>: The inherent risks of investing in startups are further amplified in Argentina due to economic instability and regulatory uncertainties, making Vanguard Venturers, with their higher risk tolerance, more prevalent.

<br/>

<b>Entrepreneurial Ecosystem</b>: Support structures for startups, such as incubators, accelerators, and networking opportunities, are not as well-developed in Argentina as in some other countries, which makes it more challenging to attract traditional angel investors.

<br/>

<b>Cultural Factors</b>: In some regions, there may be a cultural preference for more conservative investment strategies, which can discourage traditional angel investing. Vanguard Venturers, with their willingness to explore uncharted territory, are better suited to the local startup landscape.

<br/>

<b>Cultural Emphasis on Tangible Assets</b>: In Argentina, there has traditionally been a cultural preference for tangible assets, particularly real estate. Owning physical properties, such as land or buildings, is often seen as a secure and reliable investment. This preference is deeply ingrained and passed down through generations.

<br/>

<b>Short term investments</b>: In Argentina, short-term investment is a prevalent approach due to government regulations that limit the investment horizon to no more than three years, reflecting a strategy to protect assets in a volatile economic climate. However, it's important to note that startups can have longer return horizons, often taking up to ten years to yield returns, showcasing the disparity in investment time frames.

<br/>

<b>Economic History</b>: Argentina has a history of economic instability, including currency devaluations and high inflation rates. As a result, many individuals and investors in the country tend to view real estate as a more stable and inflation-resistant investment compared to the potentially riskier and volatile world of technology startups.

<br/>

<b>Limited Exposure to Tech Ecosystem</b>: The tech startup ecosystem in Argentina may not be as well-developed or as visible as the real estate sector. Investors may have limited exposure to the potential opportunities in technology startups and may not fully understand the potential for growth and innovation in this space.

<br/>

<b>Risk Aversion</b>: Due to past economic crises, many Argentines have developed a risk-averse mentality. Real estate, with its historically slow and steady appreciation, is perceived as a safer way to preserve wealth compared to the high-risk, high-reward nature of technology investments.
