# Hard and Tough UI

<br/>

Unless you are a philanthropist or the CEO of a large company, my advice is not to be creative with new physical user interfaces for personal productivity products. You can, to some extent, do it digitally however the user experience is always a bad experience to begin with. You should never mess with the UI.

Bottom line, human beings are hyper reluctant to change their habits and despite how much you want to introduce new technology you can get burned easily if you think you can change human behaviour just because you are creative or tech-savvy.

As an Industrial Designer (degreed in UBA), the physical world came very naturally when I got started with computers (see <a href="/essays/got_started" target="_blank">How I Got Started</a>). Therefore the user interface space became one of my first fields of research as a technological entrepreneur, which IMO ‚Äúauthorizes‚Äù myself to state how hard and tough the UI is. In my case and experience messing up things, big time with UI.


## Hypothesis

<br/>

As far as personal productivity goes, we humans are essentially lazy ü•±.

Allways trying to shortcut effort and work, getting the most with the least while being productive or even improve our performance.
This simple fact makes any change in that commitment towards lazyness a real threat. We take what comes easy and makes us *comfortable* with simplicity and *uncomfortable* (sometimes mad) with the sophisticated, complicated and cumbersome.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <JImage src="/images/essays/hard_tough_ui/hands_keyboard.png" width="400px" height="250px"></JImage>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p style="padding-left: 10px;">Fingers on a keyboard are the cost effective way to input information from our brain into a computer. Human beings can spend more than 8 hours working in a daily basis. Not dancing, not moving the arms or even speaking. </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

Millions of people make a living out of this energy saving. Its is a fact that pronate position of our hands without moving our arms and open elbows is the cost effective way to use our branins intensively interacting with the computer while not spending energy elsewhere in our body but our heart and main organs.

## Background

<br/>
Some of them that I personally knew and used back in 2014 while working with 2D gestures oriented to gesture interaction and motion detection like [Leap Motion](https://leapmotion.com), [Myo Armband](https://uncrate.com/myo-gesture-control-armband) and [Microsoft Kinect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/devices/kinect-for-windows).

    <td> <JImage src="/public/images/essays/hard_tough_ui/kinect.png" width="300px" height="220px"></JImage></td>
   </tr>
</table>

<br/>

Recently VR has gained traction into the interface

Just to mention some examples like [Google Glass](https://www.google.com/glass), [Meta Oculus](https://www.meta.com) and [Apple Vision](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro)

    <td> <JImage src="/public/images/essays/hard_tough_ui/apple_vision.png" width="300px" height="220px"></JImage></td>
   </tr>
</table>

## Best Use

<br/>

¬øIsn't better to grab a paper and a pen to draw an idea than to use iPad and Apple Pencil?

<br/>

## Conclusion

As far as personal productivity goes, the largest market, nothing has beaten the old fashion keyboard and it is not until we can interact directyly via our neocoertex and our brain is that will remain the same.

It is well known already of docens of super cool and *game changer* products that came to change the way how we humnas interact with computers how stumbled upon a reality

that samshed all of them.
