# How I Got Started
## on Technology

<br/>

If I have to say one of the main feature that define my personality is of being **curious** and technology is an endless field for curiosity.
But if I have to say a second then I would say being **creative** and certainly creating startups is indeed a vast terrain for creativitiy.
Not an artistic creativity but a smart and usefull one and everything in life is defined and molded when we are young.

<br/>

## [Childhood](#childhood)

<br/>

I remember my first contact with technology, regularly, was with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600_hardware" target="_blank">Atari</a> at home at the age of 8 years old where I played games like [Pacman](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) and [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) with my brother Fede and friends.

the robust joystic was intuitive enoguh to allow a full experience and interaction with different games inserted as cassetes into whats was then going to be called a console. A perfect match (perhaps one of the best) between simplicity and innovation in something that many years later would be called user experience.

<br/>

My second relevant interaction with technology came aproximately at the age of 10 when my father boguht a [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) (the first personal computer) in the US and placed it at my roon. It had a green screen and two 5¬º disk drives. By then mouse did not existed and was introduced with <a href="" Macintosh. I recall using basic program and playing Combat but nothing much sophisticated since by then I did not considered myself techy yet. I was just a child playing with something without noticing its importance.

          <p style="width: 300px; padding-left: 10px;"> These two beuties marked my childhoood. I was able to early enjoy what would then later become revolutionary and far-reaching for me. Without noticing I was exposed to two of the most iconic products of the computer era.</p>

## [Supported University](#supported-university)

<br/>

Although during high school I had to write software in a basic way for school, until that moment it did not attract my attention or like it, which is why I never considered myself a nerd.
Nor did I feel an affinity for technology or recognize my attributes to be a programmer. In fact, when I took a vocational test in high school, he told me that I should study Industrial Design and I did so. It was in this context where my creative part emerged towards design where I began to study at the UBA (University of Buenos Aires) at the age of 19. By then I mastered *Corel Draw 4*, *Autocad 12* and *3D Studio MAX*.

<br/>

The University molded me as a product creator and given tools for solving problems while undertanding the user better and better. Putting myself in the user's shoes came naturally to me. I naturally started to invent things with inmense creativity. I came up with an idea for a toothbrush system for a US company and filed a Patent Application in Argentina at the age of 20. I have proven good skills with computers and things went naturally with design programs, also in music programs with midi and sound edition. By then I explored computers for the sake of creativity only.

However I also had to make a living speccially to pay for my studies. Expensive and intensive in time consumming I had to work. I tried to get a job as an Industrial Design trinee but was useless. Technology made the call and suit well.

<br/>

## [First Job](#first-job)

<br/>

University was really tough and I had to somehow maintain my expenses therefore I looked for jobs as an Industrial Designer trainee however the experience was not good therefore I started looking elsewhere.

The opportunity came to work when I got a job as help desk and support at a company called <i>Step Online</i> for an ISP (Internet Server Provider) for *Apple Computers*. By that time there was dial up connection with modems and you had to install *Open Transport* into old Macs which sometimes ended up as a mess.

I started to get more involved in communications, I was already running AT commands on the modems and doing diagnostics. I installed a lot of software too.

However, out of those issues I ran into I also learned and I was able to do it by myself. I realized I was good with computers however by then also in love with design.

<br/>

## [Vocation](#vocation)

<br/>

One day while working at my first job in the ISP for Macs, tipically giving support to custommers, taking calls and scheduling installation visits I saw something significant that caught my attention. My boss opened a beutiful and colored box and took out a rounded computer. It was an *iMac*!! and looked like an aircraft üöÄ.

    </tr>

<br/>

Shocking and impressive, the first computer that I saw connected to the Internet natively without an external modem. Came in different colors, was fast and elegant. It was the first state of the art computer product I fallen in love with. Then the team that built it, then the company. I started dreaming big.

I was very impressed with the iMac by the amount of creativity that could fit in a computer, the more I found out the more I realized the immense field that I had in front of learning everything about computers. Even the wafer on the invoice was designed, there was nothing that was not new or innovative, they even hired a candy company to make the colored shells. A before and after for me who was in love with design and I loved computers. I saw my future.

It happened to be that the owners of the company had close connections with *Apple Argentina* (by that time present in our country) not yet into the market. Curious, I was very intrigued and started asking questions. That was the first time I heard the name *Steve Jobs*. I jumped into it.

         <td>
          <p style="width: 300px; padding-left: 10px;">It also happened to be that for creating the iMac *Steve Jobs* worked with a group of Industrisal Designers leaded by a design leader *Jonathan Ive*, my head blew up and I thogut **this is what I want to do in life** ‚ù§Ô∏è. Design, technolgoy, creativity ... and power üí™üèª. My vocation. </p>
        </td>
    </tr>

<br/>

I knew by then that in order to reach my dream I had to roll up my sleeves and get dirty with technology. I knew that I had to become a *bad ass nerd* and that pairing it with design would lead me to achieve that dream, that of creating technological products with good design.

Ever after every desition I have taken has been towards technology.

## [Information Technology](#information-technology)

<br/>

As preliminary information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology" target="_blank">Information technology</a> (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of data and information. A <a hfre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator" target="_blank">network administrator</a> is a person designated in an organization whose responsibility includes maintaining computer infrastructures with emphasis on local area networks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network" targer="_balnk">LANs</a>) up to wide area networks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network" target="_balnk">WANs</a>). While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development" target="_balnk">Software development</a> is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" target="_balnk">programming</a>, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.

<br/>

### [Learning by Building](#learning-by-building)

<br/>

Both <b>network administration</b> and <b>software development</b> have been trades that I learned on my own, with the Internet, with search engines, being mostly <a href="/started/startups#curious-and-self-taught" target="_balnk">Curious and Self-Taught</a>. I did not dedicate myself to studying <b>IT</b> at the university, I did it working and most important <b>building</b>. The best way to learn has always been building, by far and building at all risks and to the limit. That makes you really have to understand things by hook and by crook. It is what I have done in the last 20 years.

<br/>

There is no more efficient learning in life than having to learn to survive. But not only survive yourself as a human being, survive as an entrepreneur, that our company does not sink or have to be disconnected. It is not the most recommended but it is certainly an efficient way to learn. I must say that I learned a lot.

<br/>

### [Network Administrator](#network-administrator)

<br/>

After the ISP server, I went to work as a help desk in pharmaceutical laboratories such as <i>Richmond</i> and then went to the <a href="https://www.ospg.org.ar" target="_blank">Obra Social del Personal Grafico</a> aka OSPG (graphic union) where I began to provide help desk support and stayed for years maintaining the network until I was responsible for the area of technology.

<br/>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <p style="width: 400px; padding-right: 10px;">Amongst other infrastructure responsibilities I was keeping over 100 computers connected to a Microsoft domain network running Windows NT4 with Active Directory running on top of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProLiant" target="_balnk">Compaq Proliant Server</a> 5500 with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/" target="_balnk">Oracle Database</a> and custom health systems. I was responsible for backup and disaster recovery <a href="https://www.veritas.com/" target="_balnk">Veritas Backup</a> with tapes. At that time I really liked working with irons, I also put <b>HP</b> and <b>AS400</b> servers to work, however the Proliant marked me at one point in my life. Where I understood the power of what is now defined as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_balnk">cloud computing</a>. This incipient knowledge helped me to understand a lot what could happen in the future.</p>

<br/>

fixed computers hardware and software, also cloned them and wrote sophisticated login scripts for automation.

I learned many things on my own that marked me forever in a real technology playground. I remember two significant events linked to a consultant Jose Lipari who had introduced me to work where in a random conversation about software he asked: <i>Do you know what a variable is?</i>. I answered I didn't. From that point things started to look different. Similar to the <a href="/previous/roamingkeyboards#eureca" target="_blank">Eureca Moment</a> and during the same time, I began to believe. I began to believe that I could also be capable of writting softeare. I was not a kid, nor young but a massive passion of y dream drove me to start learning. It was at that time that I started learning how to write software, on my own of course since by 2001 there was already an incipient Internet full of new resources.

<br/>

### [Software Developer](#software-developer)

<br/>

Althoguh I did computer programs during my secondary with the first series of cloned computer running DOS. I was only then around the age of 25 when I came across scripting with real needs. I was working as Network Administrator while stuing Industrial Design so I was in conctac with differnet tools and platforms available to start scripting. Notice that by then sofware was not object oriented and learning to code was kind of lineal. The more commands you learnt the more powerful you became. I also had experience with command like what made things easier. The first approach to scripting came with <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications" targer="_balnk">VBA</a> (Visual Basic For Applications) where I connected a Word form to an Oracle Database via ODBC. I was so happy to se this working and solving a problem to for a customer service area that solved a big problem that they had to print a receipt for each member. I couldn't believe that I had been able to do that and it worked. That was the first moment I surprised myself about this new ability and I liked it.

<br/>

With that confidence I began to look for how to solve problems in the network and with the recommendation of the person who took me to work at the graphic union a scripting programming language similar to C++ called <b>Kixtart</b> (<a href="http://kixtart.org" target="_blank">kixtart.org</a>) that allowed to automate tasks of logging computers to the network. It was at that time when I really learnt how to program learning how to parse strings and handle single and multidimensiontal arrays. It was robust, flexible and data capable with huge possibilities for automating whatever in a computer when logged into the network. Was compatible with Windows NT Server and I was very happy to code. I ended up writting multiple automations that prevented me from going through the 100 machines on the network and that way I could install software, map drives, remove or copy files, shortcuts, touch the windows registry, connect to a database and many other things. My days working as Network Administrator became very joyfull coding login script The full story about how this language and its great community opened my mind in many ways and can be found below at <a href="/essays/started_technology#kixtart">KiXtart</a>.

<br/>

### [First and Dearest Community](#first-and-dearest-community)

<br/>

It was one day when I ran out of ideas that I came across the KiXtart.org Bulleting Board where I could ask questions to the community and get answers. However, instead I met this incredible community of people who I became friends with and I was so pleased to interact with.

<br/>

### [Learning with an IDE](#learning-with-an-ide)

<br/>

Learning with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_balnk">IDE</a> after being trained running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" target="_balnk">Windows Operating Systems</a> (setup-wizards-next-next-finish), my approach to development was not "text only" like every nerd makes his way into the world, ie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" targer="_balnk">C++</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" targer="_balnk">Bash</a> (Unix shell) command line and modern back-end lower level languages first and foremost. In my case, and coming from design, I started very slowly using very friendly programs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access" targer="_balnk">Microsoft Access</a> where I learned to play with relational databases, query interface and <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications" targer="_balnk">VBA</a> as programming languaje (thanks Valeria Rios üòâ).

<br/>

Since I came from design programs like Corel, Illustrator and Photoshop I was very familiar with them therefor when Macromedia launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" target="_blank">Flash</a> in 2004 everything started making sense. It was the first fotware that was capable of hadling design with animations powered by a scripting language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript" targer="_blank">ActionScript</a> robust enoguht for Youtube first site ran under Flash. They were the beginnings of the internet and a fashion where almost all modern sites had Flash animations. I jumped into it and became a good developer and producer. By that time I graduated and left <a href="https://www.ospg.org.ar" target="_blank">OSPG</a> because I knew I wanted to develop software and it was the closer position I could be in touch with my two worlds, design and development including technology. Then the evolution of Flash with components evolved to Flex after Macromedia was bought by Adobe and the story with Flash ended the moment Steve jobs decided not to include it into the forst iPhone meaning <a href="https://www.adobe.com/es/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html" targer="_blank">EOL</a> in short RIP ü™¶. However this technology marked my life for good since allowed me to get my fist job as a real developer and most important to lanch my humble and efficients dynamic charts published and consummed on the real web. More about that stage at <a href="/started/startups#dynamic-charts">Dynamic Chats</a>.
