The year was 2015 and my son Clemente was 8 years old. As a present father and always closely following his interests and preferences, I knew in detail his digital activities. I was very close to how he and his friends, most classmates, were very active in his digital life. My attention was drawn to the ease with which he and his friends entered and left the systems almost without control.

          <p style="width: 400px; padding-left: 10px;">During that time, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com" target="_blank">Fortnite</a> stood out as a defining game. I joined my son in his gaming adventures, witnessing him share this experience with friends, sometimes even strangers, but always within his close-knit community. He recognized the positive aspects of the game, despite its mild addictive nature, as it fostered socialization and personal challenges. I fully supported the time he dedicated to it..</p>

## [Safe and Danger Zones](#safe-and-danger-zones)

<br/>

My attention was drawn to the ease with which he and his friends entered and left the systems almost without control. Being from the guild, I was immediately able to identify the safe and dangerous areas of the virtual world. Taboo and very intriguing topic, I was entrusted with carrying out an investigation, a **research**.

<br/>

<JDate data={frontmatter.dates['Kids Research']}/> As general rules, I identified that the safest areas were **games** and the most insecure were **social networks**. In the latter, there are real problems of safety and exposure of children to pedophiles and all types of human misery within their reach. This powerfully attracted my attention with the ease with which he and his friends entered and left the systems almost without control.

## [Social Networks](#social-netowrks)

<br/>
My experience with games was quite different from that with social networks. Unlike games, I found that social networks resemble a turbulent and potentially harmful neighborhood in an overcrowded and impoverished city. Parents often lack guidance on how to introduce their children to devices at a young age, allowing them to construct their virtual personas—a costly mistake. I also identified a significant issue among children aged 5 to 12—the absence of a safe social network tailored for their age group. While platforms like Instagram have age restrictions, they fail to effectively prevent underage access, exposing children to well-known online dangers.

<br/>

## [Social Network For Kids](#social-network-for-kids)

<br/>

I created a kids' social network to address the need for a secure platform catering to children aged 5 to 12. The existing online landscape posed risks as children accessed platforms meant for older users without reliable age verification. My goal was to provide a safe digital space for kids to socialize, allowing parents to confidently oversee their online activities.

<br/>

In addition, I developed a companion mobile app for parents, integrating the school into the digital experience. Recognizing that online challenges often spill into the school environment, my aim was to establish a wholesome digital ecosystem. The kids' app offers a secure platform for peer interactions, while the parents' app facilitates communication between home and school, enabling parents to stay informed and involved. School participation in the app empowers educators to address virtual issues affecting the school environment, offering a comprehensive solution to the challenges children face in today's digital world.

<br/>

## [Application](#application)

<br/>

With my own means, rubbing shoulders in the time I could, I designed and developed a prototype of a social network application, calling the system **Gamves**.

<br/>

Android, iOS applications. Parse Server.

A mobile platform for parents and kids helping in their communication I am currently developing by my own means. The work in progress platform offers an application where kids can watch games videos just like Youtube, however, chat with school friends and make new friends under their parent's supervision and permanent connection.

By means of a second application, parents can track their activities (time spent, monitor their chats
with friends and check who they talk with) and be highly communicated as same means using the
same channel the kids use.

At present, the platform is under development and I am working in conjunction with the
headmasters and parents of St Paul’s college. With the help of the classmate's parents of my son, we
are setting up an MVP (minimum viable product) in order to expand it to other classes and ultimately
to other schools. The plan is to present the product in October 2017 in the hall in order to discuss
the problem solved and the product.
