# How I Got Started
## with English

<br/>

If I have to say one of the main feature that define my personality is curious and technology is an endless field for curiosity.
But if I have to say a second then I would say creative and certainly creating startups is indeed a vast terrain for creativitiy.
Not an artistic creativity but a smart and usefull one and everything in life is defined and molded when we are young.

## Childhood

I remember my first contact with technology, regularly, was with an [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600_hardware) at home at the age of 8 years old where I played games like [Pacman](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) and [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) with my brother Fede and friends.
the robust joystic was intuitive enoguh to allow a full experience and interaction with different games inserted as cassetes into whats was then going to be called a console. A perfect match (perhaps one of the best) between simplicity and innovation in something that many years later would be called user experience.


My second relevant interaction with technology came aproximately at the age of 10 when my father boguht a [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) (the first personal computer) in the US and placed it at my roon. It had a green screen and two 5¼ disk drives. By then mouse did not existed and was introduced with Macintosh. I recall using basic program and playing Combat but nothing much sophisticated since by then I did not considered myself techy yet. I was just a child playing with something without noticing its importance.

## University

Although during high school I had to write software in a basic way for school, until that moment it did not attract my attention or like it, which is why I never considered myself a nerd.
Nor did I feel an affinity for technology or recognize my attributes to be a programmer. In fact, when I took a vocational test in high school, he told me that I should study Industrial Design and I did so. It was in this context where my creative part emerged towards design where I began to study at the UBA (University of Buenos Aires) at the age of 19. By then I mastered Corel Draw and Autocad.

The University molded me as a product creator. I naturally started to invent things with inmense creativity. I came with a Patent Application for a toothbrush system in Argentina at the age of 20. I have proven good skills with computers and things went naturally with design programs, also in music programs with midi and sound edition. By then I explored computers for the sake of creativity only.

### First Job

University was really tough and I had to somehow maintain my expenses therefore I looked for jobs as an Industrial Designer trainee however the experience was not good therefore I started looking elsewhere.
The opportunity came to work when I got a job as a help desk and support for an ISP (Internet Server Provider) for Apple Computers. By that time there was dial up connection with modems and you had to install *Open Transport* into old Macs which sometimes ended up as a mess.

However, out of those issues I ran into I also learned and I was able to do it by myself. I realized I was good with computers however by then also in love with design.

## Vocation

One day while working at the office taking calls of customers I saw it coming. My boss opened a beutiful and colored box and took out a rounded computer. It was an *iMac*!! and looked like an aircraft 🚀.

Shocking and impressive, the first computer that I saw connected to the Internet natively without an external modem. Came in different colors, was fast and elegant. It was the first state of the art product I fallen in love.

It happened to be that the owners of the company had close connections with *Apple Argentina* (by that time present in our country) not yet into the market. Curous, I was very intrigued and the more I digged the more I fallen in love with it. That was the first time I heard the name *Steve Jobs*. I jumped into it.

<br/>

I was very impressed by the amount of creativity that could fit in a computer, the more I found out the more I realized the immense field that I had in front of learning everything about computers. Even the wafer on the invoice was designed, there was nothing that was not new or innovative, they even hired a candy company to make the colored shells. A before and after for me who was in love with design and I loved computers. I saw my future, that of designing computers.
