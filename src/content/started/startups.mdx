# How I Got Started
## with Startups


Starting a startup is an act of idealism that can be tainted with ego that can lead to a veritable meat grinder.
  Currently I fervently believe that it is in the process where the enjoyment is beyond the result and that if the expected result is not the death of anyone, depending on expectations. See my first essay <b>The Capital of Experience</b> especially <a href="/essays/capital_experience#expectations-vs-failure" target="_target">The more expectations, the bigger the failure</a>. Everything goes through expectations.

<br />

Running a startup (or more than one), which is not the same as creating one, is not easy and can sometimes be dangerous. It mainly means a daily struggle with permanent ups and downs that not everyone can tolerate. It can be created and destroyed in weeks, the challenge is to sustain it over time. Doing so is very challenging. In my case, I have found myself on the brink of collapse on more than one occasion, going through difficult times mainly because of something that at this point in my life in 2023 I think I have overcome. It boils down to one line: Enjoy the process.

<br />

### [Process vs Carrot](#process-vs-carrot)

I've been around. If there is one thing I can say after many years of riding, it is one piece of advice:

<br />

##### Don't chase the carrot, it doesn't exist, it never comes.

<br />

<br />

Enjoy the process, enjoy every moment of your construction. Do not get carried away by fashion, believe in yourself and your dreams. There is no merit. Work, work and work that enjoying the process makes you happy.

<br />

### [The Origin of My Process](#the-origin-of-my-process)

I must say that the way of life and the meaning of life of running a startup began at home. My father, an electic engineer, has been able to build engineering companies for the countryside and at home there was always an air of entrepreneurship. Since I was a child and during my <a href="/started/technology#childhood" target="_target">childhood</a> I was also surrounded by a technological environment that without realizing it absorbed. However, I don't do what I do to prove anything to anyone but because of my personality.

<br />

### Stubborn and Reckless Personality

No personality, stay at home. If you expect to be able to demonstrate a business model or create a disruptive startup of course you need to be strong and tough, but may not be enough. You must be <b>stubborn and reckless</b>, stand the pain plus a positive mind who always finds a way out on the way to his mission. I think i know who I am already and I am, some of my features:

The world is full of useless and manipulative know-it-alls "gentleman" who climb to the rank of bosses by stepping on heads in inefficient structures achieving hierarchy üòà. If you identife one stay away. If you engage, they better be customers or clients üíÅ.</p>

### [Legacy](#legacy)

I believe in legacy, its my vehicle. Why? Because I want to leave a mark on the earth. Not a small one, a mark the size of the Colorado canyon. Not because of what I do for myself but what I do for and for others affecting their lives positively. Not because of what I do for myself but what I do for and for others affecting their lives positively. Taking my ideas forward, teaching new generations, creating and building with them (<a href="/projects/maular" targer="_blank">Maular School</a>). Telling my story and leaving my bit of teaching for those who come for the future.

<b>I choose to work on my ideas and ideals. They are not negotiable.</b>
After so many years doing it, it is my way of life, my way of being in the world. Added to who I am, I wake up believing in it and I want to die doing this. However, one does not get to have that determination because yes, it is built based on convictions and dreams. I've had some hints that paved the way to startups. <b>Clues and Signs</b> that at the time I have not been able to understand but now they confirm who I am.

<br/>

### [Clues and Signs](#clues-and-signs)

It was 1996, I was 21. I had an idea for a children's toothbrush kit for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/346921Z:US" target="_target">Zooth Inc</a> that designs and distributes children's toothbrushes and toothpaste. The project consisted on two different holders with glasses, one was modular for multiple usage and the other one was individual where both came with character stickers to be placed on them by the users. They where fixed to the wall with an adhesive placed on their back.

<br/>

    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="/images/started/startups/startup_zooth_thoothbush.png" width="400px" height="335px"></img>

          <img style="padding-left: 20px;" src="/images/started/startups/startup_zooth_toothbrush_standed.png" width="250px" height="354px"></img>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

I designed it, I modeled it and I made a very well presented model. I also built te plans and presentations for the company in the United States. All on my own. Manufacturing sudies took place in China. The kit was patented in Argentina, however the project did nottake over. It was very expensive to manufacture, the molds very complex, and too expensive for a toothbrush. However the idea good.

<br/>

However my first real indicator about creating digital products came <b>accidentally</b> and almost without realizing it. As an Industrial Designer student I was convinces I would design and develop physicall producta. However my first product was digital, for the Internet and to my surprise highly demanded. It was based on dynamic charts, pies, bars and line type charts. The story goes like this.

<br/>

### [My First Product](#my-first-product)

Years later, around 2002 or so I started working at a local statup comapany in Buenos Aires called <i>Arinware Intelligent technologies S.A.</i> as a Flash AS2 Developer. The statups produced software for call centers and communication comanies. My firts task was to develop an <i>E-learning Tool</i> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaya" target="_blank">Avaya</a> with very sophisticated animations of phones displays for training custommers and personnel. By that time the company was facing financial problems and I have been asked to take a look at some charts that the <i>Technovoz</i> callcenter system was not able to run due to unpaid chats licences. Bare in mind chats by that time where very expensive. So with some preliminar calculation and a series of test scripts I was able to write -in Flash- a basic like chart that drew a random line over an x and y axis. It was weird and old fashion type of scripting since object oriented came to ActionScript afterwords in AS3 Version so I had to figure out how to solve it via synchronic code, and I did.

<br/>

I was nice. But nicer was after I got together with the .Net specialist Rodrigo Diaz and we started pushing dynamic data into it. It worked and was marvelous! The story is that I was able to develop all the suite charts including pie, bars and spider. I was amazed myself and helped the startup to avoid paying licences. However that was not what surprised me the most. It was that after I left that job I compiled all the charts and posted them on the internet on a page I used to show my work in interviews. I must have been two months after that when I was digging into the hosting server starts and found out the chats have been download used by southoands of people and all over the world.

<br/>

Unfortunately I did not undertand the meaning of that until years later. If I would I could probably not be even writting this post and enjoing my revenue like <a href="https://www.fusioncharts.com" targer="_blank">FusionCharts</a> who started at that time with similar technology as I accomplished with my very own hands. This experience opened my mind in the senso of showing me that I could build products and sell them over the Internet.

Over the yeards. The two most important things I have to be greatfull about is to continue building my experience while engaging with real people.
