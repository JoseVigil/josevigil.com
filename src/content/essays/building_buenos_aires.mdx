          <p style="width: 400px; padding-left: 10px;">  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600_hardware" target="_blank">Atari</a> at home at the age of 8 years old where I played games like [Pacman](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) and [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) with my brother Fede and friends. The robust joystic was intuitive enoguh to allow a full experience and interaction with different games inserted as cassetes into whats was then going to be called a console. A perfect match (perhaps one of the best) between simplicity and innovation in something that many years later would be called user experience.</p>
