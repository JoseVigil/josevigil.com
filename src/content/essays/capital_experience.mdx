# [The Capital of Experience](#the-Capital-of-Experience)
### [Background](#background)

Since 2007 with my first project <a href="/previous/roamingkeyboards" target="_target">Roaming Keyboards</a> I started working on my ideas putting all my knowledge of design and technology combined in the search for my idyllic dream, creating computer.

Sixteen years have passed and more than ten <a href="/previous" target="_target">previous</a> projects and a lot of experience. I can tell I was able to <a href="/essays/capital_experience#gain-experience">gain experience</a> the cost effective way possible building sturups.

<br/>

Aside from my current <a href="/projects" target="_target">projects</a>, where I learnt a lot already since for four years aldreay as my main startup <a href="/projects/notimation" target="_target">Notimation</a> in my previous experience I was able to gain more experience with <a href="/previous/padkite" target="_target">PadKite</a>, <a href="/previous/gesturekit" target="_target">GestureKit</a> and <a href="/previous/radon" target="_target">Radon</a> basically because of the effort, work, money invested and above all the very high expectations.

<br/>

If there is one thing I can say, it is that almost two decades after I started I have experience and far from feeling discouraged I am more motivated than ever with the poise of knowing that I am doing the things that make me happy in life. Create my own destiny, be my own boss and just work on my ideas. That is clear has a cost, the cost of the experience.

<br/>

I suppose that anyone who is reading this will think that it is a long time to continue in the search for dreams and I must say that for some time now I have understood that it is not about time or success or a carrot that never comes. It is about enjoying the road and accepting that it is always rocky and you never get there. With this reasoning, the day to day can be carried forward with more happiness where crises and problems are never real problems and where everything has a solution.

<br/>

This essay is one of those fundamental pending accounts to look forward to and that can only be done by acknowledging mistakes so as not to repeat them. Experience in my opinion is the most important asset one can have, more than power, more than money. It is because with experience, power and money are useless. Without experience, everything that one can achieve in life or achieve a dream can be finished overnight.

<br/>

### [Gain Experience](#gain-experience)

Without hesitation I affirm that it is when there is pain and nothing easier than exposing yourself to a situation of unsustainable pain is starting a company, your own statup, furthermore demonstrating a business model. Shortly, being an independent entrepreneur and failing, succumbing, collapsing physically, economically, psychologically is one of those ways. Exposing your meat to the slaughterhouse, showing yourself to the world naked and defenseless. That is what happens when one fails, however, it is when more experience is gained. Saving the loss of a loved one or illness, of course, does not enter into discussion in this conversation.

<br/>

### [The more expectations, the bigger the failure](#expectations-vs-failure)

There is something that I learned throughout the years and that is that <b>the more expectations, the bigger the failure</b>. This does not mean that when you create a project or a startup you should not aspire to the top, it is a must. It means not exaggerating things and believing more than what really is. Because then when the goals are not met, sometimes not even close, is when the results arrive and reality is generally seen as failure.

<br/>

The question is when one truly fails. I think the answer is the more <b>expectations</b> there are and the further from reality you live. That is very possible in the case of entrepreneurs given the nature of creating a business, a new technology or solving a real problem for our species. It is natural and I attribute it to two endemic ills: <b>procrastination</b> and <b>wishible thinking</b>, combined they generate a total abstraction of reality and the creation of unfeasible idealistic parallel worlds. These are the best friends of failures and the same under high doses of both are extremely painful. If this is the case, it is because that person has gone bankrupt, the distance from family and friends added to a personal crisis that can only happen twice in a lifetime, no more than the opposite can lose your life.

<br/>

This situation occurs basically because the solution, to stop doing what one does to achieve the dream, is in the hands of the problem, that is, oneself. That is why carrying out this profession is so difficult when so many expectations and so many dreams are at stake.

### [Gain Experience](#gain-experience)

If there is one thing I can tell about my multiple intents to demonstrate a business model is *experience*.



I can tell that if I have to say how I payed my degree as an entrepeneur has been from my pocket and the hard way, failing.
