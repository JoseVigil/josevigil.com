# How I Got Started
## with English

<br/>

My bond with the English language and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_England" target="_blank">English Culture</a> is deep and rich. I love the language, I really enjoy being able to speak, undertand and learn. I am very currious about new words, good words. The influence I had with the English culture, which is not my native culture as Argentinian, is very important and was foundational to who I am today.

<br/>

On the one hand I am from an Irish family from my mom. My second last name, is Murray and my mom family spoke a rural type of old fashioned Englishman. On the other hand, I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurlingham,_Buenos_Aires" target="_blank">Hurlingham</a>, a place of English culture surrounded by rugby clubs where I played in two of them, <a href="https://hurlingclub.com.ar/" target="_blank">Hurling</a> (from 4 to 16) and <a href="" target="_blank">Curupayti</a> (from 16 to 21). This is my story and present with this beautiful language.

<br/>

Hurlingham, my neighborhood is located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Buenos_Aires" target="_blank">Greater Buenos Aires</a> area. It is about 20 km from Argentina's capital city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires" target="_blank">Buenos Aires</a>. The city was established around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurlingham_Club" target="_blank">The Hurlingham Club</a> founded in 1888 by the English community in the area, following the original founded in Fulham (United Kingdom). Besides there is a long tradition.

### [Studies](#studies)

<br/>

I went to a bilingual school <a href="https://stpauls.edu.ar" target="_blank">St Paul's College</a> a traditional English school with a strong cultural influence that marked me where I received a very decent education and a robust foundation of the language that allowed me to develop professionally and personally. I obtained the Bachelor's degree with Orientation in Natural Sciences. School provided me access to English. The double schooling that included all the subjects in English added to the international <a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org" target="_blank">Cambridge</a> exams marked a cultural influence in the way of speaking and writing from kindergarten to finishing high school that helped me to incorporate the language naturally.

The image is the old and beloved wooden school house from my school years, later it burned down in approximately 1993 and a new building was built where my son Clemente is currently in high school where I hope he can follow the steps of learning good English, fundamental for his develpment.

### [Speak and Think in English](#speak-and-think-in-english)

<br/>

In the vicinity of my childhood home, where I lived until the age of 12, resided my best friend Marcos Hughes Hallett, also hailing from an English family background. English was the spoken language in his household, I found myself adopting the same linguistic practice. Cherished memories from those early years continue to evoke a sense of joy within me. Also sharing the residence was his cousin, Jessica Gough, with whom I maintain a lasting bond to this day.

<br/>

However, it was only in my final year of school, under the guidance of Englishman Nick Martin (may he rest in peace ðŸ˜”), that a significant shift occurred in my relationship with the English language. It was Nick who introduced us to Nigel Robets, an educator from England, tasked with imparting literature classes. This marked a pivotal turning point in my linguistic journey. Mark and I, already close friends, established a strong rapport with both Nick and Nigel, creating a unique and special connection among the four of us. A considerable amount of time was spent together at Nick's house. The fusion of the rich British cultural heritage with Mark's inherent roots, which almost rendered him an Englishman, prompted me to actively engage in our conversations.

<br/>

Our discussions spanned a wide range of captivating topics. It was during this crucial period that I began to speak with increased fluency. Gradually, the habit of mentally translating from Spanish to English waned. I discarded the need to meticulously phrase things and instead articulated my thoughts as they arose. Proficiency in English grew within me, and I discovered a genuine fondness for the language. Since then, whenever I engage in English conversation, my thoughts effortlessly flow in English, without the need for translation.
