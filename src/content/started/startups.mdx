# How I Got Started
## with Startups

<br/>

How each person understands and creates their destiny based on their vocation is a personal journey that each individual has to discover and develop. I am of the opinon that in order to create startups your vocation has to be aligned, meaning discovered and working. I have no doubt that in order to create value it is necessary to know yourself and promote it from the depths of your personality, talent, determination and work. Why? Because is a very big challenge. In my case from the ground, starting from nothing, falling, starting again from less to move forward.

<br/>

First I was able to find my <a href="/started/technology#vocation" target="_blank">vocation</a> field is a mixture between <a href="/started/design" target="_target">design</a> and <a href="/started/technology" target="_target">technology</a>, studying Industrial Design, supporting my studies in the IT business I discovered that via technolgoy I was able to produce with my own hands. Working from Help Desk to <a href="/started/technology#network-administrator" target="_target">Network Administrator</a> to <a href="/started/technology#software-developer" target="_target">Software Development</a> and so on an so forth building.

<br />

Allwas giving myself enough opportunities, experimenting and letting my curiosity test stuff, take over, letting the trigger to happen. In business environments, projects and companies, my own ones, that seek to demonstrate a business model where better if it is disruptive, about a product or service that improves people's quality of life and solves their problems. I currently work with companies but my ideal is to be able to solve the life of regular users.

<br/>

Years have passed and I have always remained faithful to my principles, in the same line of work and with the same conviction and determination as from day one. I am the creator, mentor, investor and architect of my projects. I try to carry them out with my own means, with what I have with the people around me who nurture me and give me feedback in a healthy and collaborative environment.

<br/>

I have learned a lot, so the purpose is to be able to tell how I got here and what I think determines success and failure in a startup as well as in life.

<br/>

### [Starting a Startup](#starting-a-starup)

<br/>

Starting a startup is an act of idealism that can be tainted with ego that can lead to a veritable meat grinder.
Currently I fervently believe that it is in the process where the enjoyment is beyond the result and that if the expected result is not the death of anyone, depending on expectations. See my first essay <b>The Capital of Experience</b> especially <a href="/essays/capital_experience#expectations-vs-failure" target="_target">expectation and failiure</a>. Everything goes through expectations.

<br />

Running a startup (or more than one), which is not the same as creating one, is not easy and can sometimes be dangerous. It mainly means a daily struggle with permanent ups and downs that not everyone can tolerate. It can be created and destroyed in weeks, the challenge is to sustain it over time. Doing so is very challenging. In my case, I have found myself on the brink of collapse on more than one occasion, going through difficult times mainly because of something that at this point in my life in 2023 I think I have overcome. It boils down to one line: Enjoy the process.

<br />

### [Process vs Carrot](#process-vs-carrot)

<br/>

Success stories, happy millionaires, the new world of technology rockstars added to a general ignorance of what it means to run a startup and even more so a disruptive business model = a miracle of nature. It means something trivial and it is very easy to confuse why and when one reaches that privileged place that these "enlightened" people have. I no longer look at others and I don't care if they are doing well or badly, I really don't care because what I do makes me happy, enough.

<br/>

I've been around. If there is one thing I can say after many years of riding, it is one piece of advice:

<br />

##### Don't chase the carrot, it doesn't exist, it never comes.

<br />

![Carrot](/images/started/startups/startup_carrot.png)

<br />

Enjoy the process, enjoy every moment of your construction. Do not get carried away by fashion, believe in yourself and your dreams. There is no merit. Work, work and work that enjoying the process makes you happy.

<br />

### [The Origin](#the-origin)

<br />

I must say that the way of life and the meaning of life of running a startup began at home. My father, an electic engineer, has been able to build engineering companies for the countryside and at home there was always an air of entrepreneurship. Since I was a child and during my <a href="/started/technology#childhood" target="_target">childhood</a> I was also surrounded by a technological environment that without realizing it absorbed. However, I don't do what I do to prove anything to anyone but because of my personality.

<br />

### [Stubborn and Reckless](#stubborn-and-reckless)

<br />

No personality, stay at home. If you expect to be able to demonstrate a business model or create a disruptive startup of course you need to be strong and tough, but may not be enough. You must be <b>stubborn and reckless</b>, stand the pain plus a positive mind who always finds a way out on the way to his mission. I think i know who I am already and I am, some of my features:

I do not recognize anyone above, only together, except for rare exceptions where I find myself working with extraordinary people whom I respect and admire. The world is full of useless and manipulative know-it-alls "gentleman" who climb to the rank of bosses by stepping on heads in inefficient structures achieving hierarchy üòà. If you identife one stay away. If you engage, they better be customers or clients üíÅ.</p>

          <p style="width: 600px;">Sometimes at unimaginable levels my head is constantly living with new creative ideas and everything I do in my productive life is driven by my creativity üí´. This comes naturally in many things I can do. Statups are indeed a very creative field of interaction therefore my choice in life.</p>
          <br/>
          <p style="width: 600px;">For some unknown reason I am capable of analyzing in my mind multiple types of data that I sense in a premeditated and accidental way. I obtain information about the world, people and things through creative intelligence and sensitivity. That allows me to play with all that information effortlessly and put it on the plane of ideas mixing them like in an amusement park. It's something that comes naturally to me and I don't know why yet.</p>
          <br/>
          <p style="width: 600px;"><b>Disclaimer</b>: I must say that being creative is not necessarily good if what one does is just carry out ideas and it is necessary to be very prudent when doing so. Especially when you are trying to demonstrate business models. For this reason I have spent a large part of my life trying to put my creativity on the ground and only now am I able to do it more efficiently. ...see <a href="/started/startups#personality-side-effects" targer="_balnk">Personality Side-Effects</a><br/></p>

I handle myself with intuition and it is a type of intelligence that also comes out to me. When I meet a person or when I have to forecast a business, I use my intuition and I find it very efficient. This point is also very important when making decisions.</p>
          <br/>
          <p style="width: 600px;">Sometimes the untuition also leads me to make mistakes, especially on a personal level. In general, what happens to me is that I can be very intuitive at the beginning of a relationship, sensing the behavior of that person, but it does not apply in the medium and long term.<br/></p>

#### [Personality Side-Effects](#personality-side-effects)

<br />

Undoubtedly, the five characteristics of a personality that builds and pushes forward with effort, determination and will are fundamental and without that forget it. But they are not enough and are often counterproductive when it comes to demonstrating a disruptive business model in technology. What an entrepreneur must build with that strength and energy is to be what doesn't work out for us, what is difficult. Being <b>petty</b>, <b>calculating</b> and <b>suspicious</b> is just as important as being positive üôäüôâüôà.

<br />

You need to find a balance otherwise you never come down to earth. Unfortunately, reality is built with data not dreams and build a possible reality that must be validated every day. It is necessary to polish the hardest aspects of our personality to achieve it. That is where the real challenge of undertaking is. Doing what one doesn't like or doesn't like. Mitigating uncertainty, achieving the necessary balance to do it well and do it more than once well. Which inexorably leads us to leave a legacy, the one that each one leaves on earth.

<br />

### [Legacy](#legacy)

<br />

I believe in legacy, its my vehicle. Why? Because I want to leave a mark on the earth. Not a small one, a mark the size of the Colorado canyon. Not because of what I do for myself but what I do for and for others affecting their lives positively. Not because of what I do for myself but what I do for and for others affecting their lives positively. Taking my ideas forward, teaching new generations, creating and building with them (<a href="/projects/maular" targer="_blank">Maular School</a>). Telling my story and leaving my bit of teaching for those who come for the future.

<br/>

![Carrot](/images/started/startups/startup_colorado.png)

<br/>

<b>I choose to work on my ideas and ideals. They are not negotiable.</b>
After so many years doing it, it is my way of life, my way of being in the world. Added to who I am, I wake up believing in it and I want to die doing this. However, one does not get to have that determination because yes, it is built based on convictions and dreams. I've had some hints that paved the way to startups. <b>Clues and Signs</b> that at the time I have not been able to understand but now they confirm who I am.

<br/>

### [Clues and Signs](#clues-and-signs)

<br/>

Entrepreneur is not born, it is made. However, on the way to becoming one, the first thing that is essential is to identify if there are signs and signals that allow you to recognize if you are made for this. Generally, they are events and events that we are not aware of, where later people around us or ourselves are capable of assessing their exact magnitude. In my case I had two signs that convinced me that I was capable, where the second showed me the way from my place in the world to Buenos Aires. The first with a physical hardware product and the second with a digital product. Clearly I could understand where I should go considering my limitations.

<br/>

#### [Product Minded](#product-minded)

<br/>

Studying <a href="/started/design#industrial-design" target="_blank">Industrial Design</a> sets your mind in products, you become product minded. It was 1996, I was 21. I had an idea for a children's toothbrush kit for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/346921Z:US" target="_target">Zooth Inc</a> that designs and distributes children's toothbrushes and toothpaste. The project consisted on two different holders with glasses, one was modular for multiple usage and the other one was individual where both came with character stickers to be placed on them by the users. They where fixed to the wall with an adhesive placed on their back.

<br/>

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

I designed it, I modeled it and I made a very well presented model. I also built te plans and presentations for the company in the United States. All on my own. Manufacturing sudies took place in China. The kit was patented in Argentina, however the project did nottake over. It was very expensive to manufacture, the molds very complex, and too expensive for a toothbrush. However the idea good.

<br/>

However my first real indicator about creating digital products came <b>accidentally</b> and almost without realizing it. As an Industrial Designer student I was convinces I would design and develop physicall producta. However my first product was digital, for the Internet and to my surprise highly demanded. It was based on dynamic charts, pies, bars and line type charts. The story goes like this.

<br/>

#### [First Digital Product](#first-digital-product)

<br/>

Years later, around 2002 I decided to leave <a href="/started/technology#network-administrator" target="_target">the land administration</a> work I moved towards software. I started working at a local statup comapany in Buenos Aires called <i>Arinware Intelligent technologies S.A.</i> as a Flash AS2 Developer. The statups produced software for call centers and communication comanies. My firts task was to develop an <i>E-learning Tool</i> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaya" target="_blank">Avaya</a> with very sophisticated animations of phones displays for training custommers and personnel. By that time the company was facing financial problems and I have been asked to take a look at some charts that the <i>Technovoz</i> callcenter system was not able to run due to unpaid chats licences. Bare in mind chats by that time where very expensive.

<br/>

##### [Dynamic Charts](#dynamic-charts)

<br/>


So unintentionally and out of curiosity I found myself having to write some lines of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript" targer="_blank">ActionScript</a> with trivial scripts that would draw lines and areas, first static then dynamic. The outcome made sense üí™. With some preliminar calculation and a series of test scripts I was able to write -in Flash- a basic like chart that drew a random line over an x and y axis. It was weird and old fashion type of scripting since object oriented came to ActionScript afterwords in AS3 Version so I had to figure out how to solve it via synchronic code, and I did.

<br/>

I was nice. But nicer was after I got together with the .Net specialist Rodrigo Diaz and we started pushing dynamic data into it. It worked and was marvelous! The story is that I was able to develop all the suite charts including pie, bars and spider. I was amazed myself and helped the startup to avoid paying licences. However that was not what surprised me the most. It was that after I left that job I compiled all the charts and posted them on the internet on a page I used to show my work in interviews. I must have been two months after that when I was digging into the hosting server starts and found out the chats have been download used by southoands of people and all over the world.

<br/>

Unfortunately I did not undertand the meaning of that until years later. If I would I could probably not be even writting this post and enjoing my revenue like <a href="https://www.fusioncharts.com" targer="_blank">FusionCharts</a> who started at that time with similar technology as I accomplished with my very own hands. This experience opened my mind in the senso of showing me that I could build products and sell them over the Internet.

<br/>

<b>Conclusion :</b> Over the yeards. The two most important things I have to be greatfull about is to continue building my experience while engaging with real people.

<br/>


### [I do IT my way](#i-do-it-my-way)

<br/>

It has been through <a href="/essays/capital_experience" targer="_balnk">The Capital of Experience</a> that I have learned how to create startups. Always putting everything and living my dream to achieve happiness. For me this is a dream and being able to live it fills me with joy. It is my way of being in the world.

<br/>

If there's one thing I can be proud of in this life, it's that I never gave up and I'm not going to. I will continue until I reach my dream, leave my <a href="/started/startups#legacy" targer="_balnk">legacy</a>. It's my way and that's how I do things.

<br/>

-> <b>Build</b><br/>
I am a builder, good or bad I build and create. I am in charge and responsible for carrying out a project from end to end. I have the idea, I put together the team, the company, the networks and the technology to gain value through a disruptive product.<br/>
<br/>

-> <b>Forecast</b><br/>
I see the future, I am able to predict it. I vibrate in what can happen by making a forecast, I can anticipate.<br/>
<br/>


‚óè   - I don't copy anyone, I work on my ideas. I never carry out third-party ideas for technology projects, unless they are spin-offs from my community.

‚óè   - I build my model with my hands and my resources.

‚óè   - I don't pitch to investors until I have validated my idea in the market and actually found value.

‚óè   - Above all, I do things my way, based on my experience, whatever the cost.

‚óè   - I do not compromise souls of relatives, no more. If I don't have money to do something, I don't do it. I rummage to generate it.
