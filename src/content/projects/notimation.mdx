## [Notimation Origin](#notimation-origin)

<br />

Around 2019, my cousin Nicolas Alen (Nico) and I got together to work with a simple idea: <b>create an inexpensive way to send SMS</b>. We had a nice previous experience working together with <a href="/previous/negociometro" target="_blank">Negociometro</a> so we got started smoothly and fast. Initially we thought about sending SMS via Android phone with a chip. In fact coded and app for consumming a backend however early on time we undertood we should look for something more rogust, in terms of communication equipments and team.
