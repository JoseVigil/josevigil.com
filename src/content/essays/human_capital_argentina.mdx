Argentina is undoubtedly a peculiar place. From having been a world power at the beginning of the 21st century, we became one of the most corrupt countries in Latin America, going through the pain of having 10 financial crises, losing 5 monetary signs to become an underdeveloped country, all of this in less than a century. Not even "on purpose" can things go so badly for a country with the impressive natural resources and the well-known innovation that we show, it is unacceptable, we are still processing why. However, Argentina retains enormous values in terms of human resources. If I had to put it in a single line, why does this happen in Argentina.

<br/>

In Argentina there is a very particular characteristic of highly creative people capable of solving problems by improvising on the fly, inventing and resisting extreme situations as if they were made for it. This, in my opinion, is the product of a very good European base of immigrants who at the beginning of the 21st century managed to establish a very robust cultural and educational base. However, the level of chaos and permanent crisis also affects us, leading us to an already emotional stability that puts us in a state of natural creative wakefulness. This has been demonstrated in different human aspects in sports, science and entrepreneurship. For example, my university UBA produced 5 Novel awards and there have already been 8 unicorns created by Argentina. Without mentioning Pope Francis, Messi and Maradona. Something is happening in Argentina and I consider myself another product of the long list of extraordinary and creative people who are molded in our country. For all this, I believe that the future of our country and many of humanity's advances are in the hands of young people.
