# How I Got Started
## with Design

During my last year at height school I took vocational test. The result was Industrial Design. By then it was a very modern type of architecture and a futurist and fit very well into what was evident in me, an inmense universe of creativuty that it was aovbious I was capable of giving to the world. My syster Caro studied architecture at <a hre="https://www.fadu.uba.ar/" target="_blank">FADU-UBA</a> and I was encourage to go to the same on. Ny father was not that happy unfortunately however I moved forward.

          <p style="width: 300px; padding-left: 10px;"> I had a strong message to be an artisti. I was always very creative, I could have been an artist and I had some indications to do it. I remember that in 1998 I was participating in the assembly of an Industrial Design stand for the <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/comenzo-buenos-aires-no-duerme-98-nid104473/" target="">Buenos Aires No Duerme</a> festival working for my friend Micaela Saconni when I decided to participate in a painting contest organized by Levi to paint pants whose prize was a trip to the USA and clothes. I remember I was badly asleep because of the deliveries of the faculty, stressed and tired. I decided to participate and I painted a light brown background and some plants with flowers. I finished and went to sleep. </p>

I woke up with a call telling me that I had <b>won the contest</b> üèÜ. I was surprised. I really was not expecting to win. I gave clothes to my friends and did not use the ticket unfortunately. Today I think that I could have gone to study arts, life showed me another path, I will have time to make art in the future. I can be an artist after I fulfill my dreams.
