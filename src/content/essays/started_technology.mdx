# How I Got Started
## on Technology

<br/>

If I have to say one of the main feature that define my personality is of being **curious** and technology is an endless field for curiosity.
But if I have to say a second then I would say being **creative** and certainly creating startups is indeed a vast terrain for creativitiy.
Not an artistic creativity but a smart and usefull one and everything in life is defined and molded when we are young.

## [Childhood](#childhood)

I remember my first contact with technology, regularly, was with an [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600_hardware) at home at the age of 8 years old where I played games like [Pacman](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) and [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) with my brother Fede and friends.
the robust joystic was intuitive enoguh to allow a full experience and interaction with different games inserted as cassetes into whats was then going to be called a console. A perfect match (perhaps one of the best) between simplicity and innovation in something that many years later would be called user experience.

My second relevant interaction with technology came aproximately at the age of 10 when my father boguht a [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) (the first personal computer) in the US and placed it at my roon. It had a green screen and two 5¬º disk drives. By then mouse did not existed and was introduced with Macintosh. I recall using basic program and playing Combat but nothing much sophisticated since by then I did not considered myself techy yet. I was just a child playing with something without noticing its importance.

## [University](#university)

Although during high school I had to write software in a basic way for school, until that moment it did not attract my attention or like it, which is why I never considered myself a nerd.
Nor did I feel an affinity for technology or recognize my attributes to be a programmer. In fact, when I took a vocational test in high school, he told me that I should study Industrial Design and I did so. It was in this context where my creative part emerged towards design where I began to study at the UBA (University of Buenos Aires) at the age of 19. By then I mastered *Corel Draw 4*, *Autocad 12* and *3D Studio MAX*.

The University molded me as a product creator and given tools for solving problems while undertanding the user better and better. Putting myself in the user's shoes came naturally to me. I naturally started to invent things with inmense creativity. I came up with an idea for a toothbrush system for a US company and filed a Patent Application in Argentina at the age of 20. I have proven good skills with computers and things went naturally with design programs, also in music programs with midi and sound edition. By then I explored computers for the sake of creativity only.

## [First Job](#first-job)

University was really tough and I had to somehow maintain my expenses therefore I looked for jobs as an Industrial Designer trainee however the experience was not good therefore I started looking elsewhere.
The opportunity came to work when I got a job as a help desk and support for an ISP (Internet Server Provider) for *Apple Computers*. By that time there was dial up connection with modems and you had to install *Open Transport* into old Macs which sometimes ended up as a mess.

I started to get more involved in communications, I was already running AT commands on the modems and doing diagnostics. I installed a lot of software too.

However, out of those issues I ran into I also learned and I was able to do it by myself. I realized I was good with computers however by then also in love with design.

## [Vocation](#vocation)

One day while working at my first job in the ISP for Macs, tipically giving support to custommers, taking calls and scheduling installation visits I saw something significant that caught my attention. My boss opened a beutiful and colored box and took out a rounded computer. It was an *iMac*!! and looked like an aircraft üöÄ.

Shocking and impressive, the first computer that I saw connected to the Internet natively without an external modem. Came in different colors, was fast and elegant. It was the first state of the art computer product I fallen in love with. Then the team that built it, then the company. I started dreaming big.

I was very impressed with the iMac by the amount of creativity that could fit in a computer, the more I found out the more I realized the immense field that I had in front of learning everything about computers. Even the wafer on the invoice was designed, there was nothing that was not new or innovative, they even hired a candy company to make the colored shells. A before and after for me who was in love with design and I loved computers. I saw my future.

It happened to be that the owners of the company had close connections with *Apple Argentina* (by that time present in our country) not yet into the market. Curious, I was very intrigued and started asking questions. That was the first time I heard the name *Steve Jobs*. I jumped into it.

          <p style="width: 300px; padding-left: 10px;">It also happened to be that for creating the iMac *Steve Jobs* worked with a group of Industrisal Designers leaded by a design leader *Jonathan Ive*, my head blew up and I thogut **this is what I want to do in life** ‚ù§Ô∏è. Design, technolgoy, creativity ... and power üí™üèª. My vocation. </p>

I knew by then that in order to reach my dream I had to roll up my sleeves and get dirty with technology. I knew that I had to become a *bad ass nerd* and that pairing it with design would lead me to achieve that dream, that of creating technological products with good design.

Ever after everry desition I have taken has been towards technology.
