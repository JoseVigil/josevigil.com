# How I Got Started
## with English

<br/>

My bond with the English language and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_England" target="_blank">English Culture</a> is deep and rich. I love the language, I really enjoy being able to speak, undertand and learn. I am very currious about new words, good words. The influence I had with the English culture, which is not my native culture as Argentinian, is very important and was foundational to who I am today.

<br/>

On the one hand I am from an Irish family from my mom. My second last name, is Murray and my mom family spoke a rural type of old fashioned Englishman. On the other hand, I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurlingham,_Buenos_Aires" target="_blank">Hurlingham</a>, a place of English culture surrounded by rugby clubs where I played in two of them, <a href="https://hurlingclub.com.ar/" target="_blank">Hurling</a> (from 4 to 16) and <a href="" target="_blank">Curupayti</a> (from 16 to 21). This is my story and present with this beautiful language.

<br/>

Hurlingham, my neighborhood is located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Buenos_Aires" target="_blank">Greater Buenos Aires</a> area. It is about 20 km from Argentina's capital city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires" target="_blank">Buenos Aires</a>. The city was established around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurlingham_Club" target="_blank">The Hurlingham Club</a> founded in 1888 by the English community in the area, following the original founded in Fulham (United Kingdom). Besides there is a long tradition.

<br/>

I went to a bilingual school <a href="https://stpauls.edu.ar" target="_blank">St Paul's College</a> a traditional English school with a strong cultural influence that marked me where I received a very decent education and a robust foundation of the language that allowed me to develop professionally and personally. The double schooling that included all the subjects in English added to the international <a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org" target="_blank">Cambridge</a> exams marked a cultural influence in the way of speaking and writing from kindergarten to finishing high school that helped me to incorporate the language naturally.



<br/>

In front of my house, where I lived right after school until I was 12 years old, lived my best friend Marcos Hughes Hallett, also from an English family. English was spoken in that house and when I went I had to do it too. I have very special memories from my childhood of that place that will remain forever in my memory with happiness. He also lived with his cousin Jessica Gough with whom I maintain a relationship to this day.

<br/>

However it wasn't until my last year of school with Englishman Nick Martin (rip ðŸ˜”) as headmaster, that he brought a teacher from England called Nigel Robets to give us literature classes that marked a before and after in my awakening of the language. Mark and I, who are already best friends, got on very well with Nick and Nigel and a very special bond was established between the four of us. We spent a lot of time together at Nick's house. The classic and superb cultural baggage of the British plus the native roots of Mark, who was practically an Englishman, meant I had to be up to the conversations as one more.

<br/>

We talked a lot and about many super interesting things. It was at that very important moment where I began to speak more fluently and without realizing it I stopped translating from Spanish to English in my head when speaking. I stopped caring how I said things, I just said what came to my mind. I started to speak very good English and I liked it a lot. Since then when I speak English it's because I'm thinking in English.
