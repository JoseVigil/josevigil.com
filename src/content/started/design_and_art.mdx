# [How I Got Started](#how-i-got-sstarted)
### [with Design & Art](#with-design-art)

<br/>

Design and especially art is possibly what comes most naturally to me. I consider myself a born artist with enormous curiosity and learning ability whose passion is to create things that can solve problems or improve people's lives through disruptive technological business models. Nothing simple but super fun and entertaining. Without a doubt, art is something that I will practice in the future, however, while I pursue my mission, I will work in design, development and entrepreneurship. A vast field to be creative. My history with design dates back to my teens, with a few fringes of art happily dotting my life.

<br/>

### [Beginnings in Design](#beginnings-in-design)

<br/>

During my last year at height school I took vocational test. The result was Industrial Design. By then it was a very modern type of architecture and a futurist and fit very well into what was evident in me, an inmense universe of creativuty that it was aovbious I was capable of giving to the world. My syster Caro studied architecture at <a href="https://www.fadu.uba.ar/" target="_blank">FADU</a> UBA (Universidad de Buenos Aires) and I was encourage to go to the same on. Ny father was not that happy unfortunately however I moved forward.

<br/>

### [Industrial Designer](#industrial-designer)

<br/>

I have not had a professional career as a classic Industrial Designer. My path was marked by technology and digital design from the very beginning. So much so that I sustained my studies working in the IT sector. In this way I support my studies ...<a href="/started/technology#supported-university" target="_blank">Supported University</a>.

<br/>

My professional carrer as an Industrial Designer has not

I worked on many designs within the project and conceptual framework of industrial design, however few projects that marked my future and <a href="/started/technology#vocation" target="_balnk">vocation</a>.

##### [El Server](#el-server)

<br/>

In 2007 I really enjoyed working on the design of a server computer for the company <a href="https://elserver.com" target="_balnk">El Server</a> (web hosting) where your logo is materialized on a server with personality that shows the brand attributes. It was super interesting for me since joined my two passions: technology and design.

### [Artist Traits](#artist-traits)

<br/>

From a very young age I had a knack for art and creativity. Accompanied by a series of plastic and musical skills, I was able to really enjoy drawing and making music. Art is a joy for me and comes naturally. Since it does not represent effort, I possibly took on enormous challenges in my dreams where art is related but not central to my life but rather enjoyment.

<br/>

          <p style="width: 360px; padding-left: 10px;"> <JDate data={frontmatter.dates['First Drawing']}/> At 5 years old he showed concrete evidence of ease of expression in drawing. This is a drawing that I find more than 40 years later and I am surprised to see the clarity of how it communicates space, lines, the use of colors and morphologies that, without abusing the line, composes shapes and details that attract attention for so little age. Striking just by looking at the tent, the center and focus of the drawing, the stakes of the tent perpendicular to the thread that is stretched, the folding of the door folded in movement, the clear differentiation of functions between the roof and the tent in view comprising volumes, the use of color. The fire, symbolized with two lines and a spark detail, the clear trunks and with the use of shadow and light. The pot with two clear handles and a solid color held on a board. The tree and the moon are less protagonists and out of focus. The moon, with a weak line that gives texture with details generating volume. I could continue finding details, there are many. It's amazing.</p>

#### [Art Outbursts](#art-outbursts)

<br/>

<JDate data={frontmatter.dates['Art Outbursts']}/> During this year, on two occasions I had artistic outbursts inspired by the moment that in each of the techniques I did not use it before or after and only once. Between the ages of 22 and 25 I had many artistic inspirations that pushed me to do things that spontaneously arose without planning. This is the case of a painting in actuarels and a sculpture of a face made in ceramic.

       </td>
       <td>
          <p style="width: 280px; padding-left: 10px;">I have experimented little with different art techniques, for example the use of watercolors was more interesting to me than pastel. It's not so easy to get the best result the first time I use it but I found it fun. Likewise with ceramics, I found myself in a place in my mother's field where my cousins have kilns and it occurred to me to model a caricature. I also had a lot of fun. It was the first time I used both techniques and I never used them again. I hope one day I return to art and continue researching techniques. Later when I manage to demonstrate some of the technology business models that I am developing.</p>

#### [Painting Award](#painting-award)

<br/>

<JDate data={frontmatter.dates['Buenos Aires No Duerme']}/> Also spontaneously and as a relief and discharge I participated in a drawing contest and to my surprise I won it. The prize was a trip to Europe (which I never used) and clothes from the organizing brand that I give to friends. For some reason that was not my time for art and I decided to work in technology, who says what would have happened if with that ticket I went to study art in Europe I probably wouldn't be writing this. I had allways had great skills for art, drawing, plastic music so it came naturally to me to do it. However it was never profitable, except for once.

<br/>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <JImage src="/images/started/design/design_buenos_aires_no_duerme.png" width="370px"></JImage>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p style="width: 380px; padding-left: 10px;"> I had a strong message to be an artisti. I was always very creative, I could have been an artist and I had some indications to do it. I remember that in 1998 I was participating in the assembly of an Industrial Design stand for the <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/comenzo-buenos-aires-no-duerme-98-nid104473/" target="_blank">Buenos Aires No Duerme</a> festival working for my friend <b>Micaela Saconni</b> when I decided to participate in a painting contest organized by Levi to paint pants. I remember I was badly asleep because of the deliveries of the faculty, stressed and tired. I decided to participate in the very last moment of the competition. I painted a light brown background and some plants with flowers. I thought about painting a pantheon on each leg but by the time there were 5 minutes left to finish I had only covered it with base paint, at that moment I decided to paint some flower vines and it turned out very well. I finished and went to sleep üò¥.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

I woke up with a call telling me that I had <b>won the contest</b> üèÜ. I was surprised. I really was not expecting to win. I gave clothes to my friends and did not use the ticket unfortunately. Today I think that I could have gone to study arts, life showed me another path, I will have time to make art in the future. I can be an artist after I fulfill my dreams.

<br/>

#### [Cartoons Sketches](#cartoons-sketches)

<br/>

<JDate data={frontmatter.dates['Cartoons']}/> Stated sketching. As a child I had drawing skills and at an early age my drawings had meaning and expression. Drawing helped me a lot to develop my career as an Industrial Designer and at some point I also dreamed of being able to create my own characters and cartoons or movies. I found very inspiring and creative drawing sketeches in hardcover accounting book with numbered white pages where I scribbled shapes and gave them a character and expression through drawing.

<br/>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <JImage src="/images/started/design/design_dibujos_copiador.png" width="175px"></JImage>

        <td>
          <JImage src="/images/started/design/design_dibujos.png" width="300px" pl="10"></JImage>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p style="width: 270px; padding-left: 10px;">I developed a drawing system where I would draw some lines on the paper and imagine a character or an object or shape and then redefine it with shadows and contrasts. This led me to find and invent characters that, when I have the resources, I can bring to life through one or more scripts. I think there is a fantastic world to explore in this book. A treasure for me üßà.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br/>

In this imaginary universe full of life and personal objects, environments, aliens and animals, there are stories that cross imaginary worlds that want to be told. Sometimes the most irrelevant and hidden curves can create the best characters, with greater expression and life of their own. These are some who can start telling their stories.
