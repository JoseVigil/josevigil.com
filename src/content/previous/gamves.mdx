# Gamves

Android, iOS applications. Parse Server.

A mobile platform for parents and kids helping in their communication I am currently developing by
my own means. The work in progress platform offers an application where kids can watch games
videos just like Youtube, however, chat with school friends and make new friends under their
parent's supervision and permanent connection.
By means of a second application, parents can track their activities (time spent, monitor their chats
with friends and check who they talk with) and be highly communicated as same means using the
same channel the kids use.
At present, the platform is under development and I am working in conjunction with the
headmasters and parents of St Paulâ€™s college. With the help of the classmate's parents of my son, we
are setting up an MVP (minimum viable product) in order to expand it to other classes and ultimately
to other schools. The plan is to present the product in October 2017 in the hall in order to discuss
the problem solved and the product.
