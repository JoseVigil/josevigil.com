# Roaming Keyboards

Bu the end of 2006, I graduated as an Industrial Designer in <a href="https://www.fadu.uba.ar/categoria/53-diseo-industrial" target="_blank">UBA University</a> and my son Clemente was about to be born (Jan 2007) I was eager to start merging my both knowlerges and passions Technology and Design.

I knew by that time that my real <a href="/essays/started_technology#vocation" target="_blank">vocation</a> was around Industrial Design and Software Engineering. Jumped into by participating in an Industrial Design contest from Microsoft called <i>StartSomethingPC</i> with my friend <a href="http://hernanfretto.com/" target="_blank">Hernan Fretto</a> one of the best designers in Argentina with a deep understanding in ergenomics.

## [Research](#research)

We focused on computer interfaces specially how we input information. After a preliminar research <i><a href="/images/previous/roamingkeyboards/research_startsomethingpC.pdf" target="_blank">Research StartSomethingPC</a></i> (12/02/2006) throowed that input specifically keyboards had a lot of space for improvement. We saw value in two products:

        <td>
            <p style="width: 250px; padding-left: 10px;"> The Russian <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus" target="_blank">Optimus Keyboard</a> (still active) with an innotvative key customization key display via sofware and an a novel touch sensitive keyboard from <i>Fireworks</i> with an erganomic fold and touch sensivitivyty.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

I was at that time when I though about dynamic interfaces when suddenly Hernan told me: <b>Why don't we do it touch screen? Better, multitouch. </b> ... He blew my mind ðŸ’¥. I knew about servers, thin clients, terminals, phones, hardware, software, data and interfaces. Just needed the spark to undertand the big picture and see the vision.

There was no such technology as multitouch in the market yet. The iPhone was introduced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg" target="_blank">Steve Jobs MacWorld keynote in 2007</a> therefore it was difficult to forecast where this would have ever be a reality.

the only available product in the world by 2016 was the the legendary <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6zOdRwgIRQ" target="_blank">Lemur multitouch MIDI/OSC controller</a></b> from the french company Stamtum was a pioneer product. It was created for playing music and it was beutiful, the singer Biorg used one.

## [Roaming Keyboards Concept](#concept)

So I came up with an idea of a computer system for a smart home built with <b>agnostic touch screen interfaces</b> that could alternatively provide displays, keyboards, touchpads accordigly to the amount of devices, sizes and needs. Each setup would have a different functinality such as desktop, tablet, laptop with external keyboard. The system would run on thin client system or remote desktop allowing the resize of the display.

The concept of a roaming keyboard means that your keyboard, display or multitouchpad could roam around different devices allowing the best customization for the user prferred setup.

I imagined a future where all the glasses of a household could be turned into a computer screen to display thin client OS while controling it from a remote terminal with a keyboard or a touchpad, a multitouchad.

## [Patent](#patent)

After my first drafts, I was very enthusiastic about filing my ideas so I started filing patent applications at the US office. As a result, I filed 7 patent application on the use of gestures and innovative dynamic interfaces. I have been granted with one patent related to the use of remote gestures to control smart TVs.

## Thin terminal computer architecture utilizing roaming keyboard files

![Roaming Keyboards](/images/previous/roamingkeyboards/roamingkeyboards_main_patent_layout.png)

A thin client server system including a client server configured to transfer at least one roaming keyboard file to at least one thin client terminal is described. The thin client terminal includes a touch-sensitive interface, session layout module and a client processing module. The session layout module generates a selection configuration for selecting the type of interaction with the client server system. The client processing module applies the at least one roaming keyboard file and to dynamically generate, input sub-modules for receiving communication from at least one user and an output sub-module for generating output to at least one user. The generated input sub-module including, a virtual keyboard sub-module, and a pointer-pad sub-module and the generated output sub-module including a virtual screen sub-module for generating output to at least one user, wherein the client sever allows modular collaboration while multiplexing input and output message between sub-modules.

. I started to put everything together, I imagined a world of touch screen and dynamic interfaces. I dram a world where interfaces all around us are connected to a server



I did not imagined how important touch screen technology would become such a standard specially when the iPhone was not launched yet.
