# How I Got Started
## Teaching

<br/>

Teaching is currently part of my daily life. Training people, professionals and making them better is without a doubt one of the reasons why I subscribe to leaving a <a href="/essays/capital_experience#legacy" target="_blank">legacy</a>. Through different ways where I got closer to the youngest is where I discovered the power of teaching, for oneself and especially for those with great potential and future. Although more recently I have found myself standardizing teaching procedures with <a href="/projects/maular" targer="_blank">Maular School</a>, my approach to teaching was born a few years ago after becoming internalized about the problems of boys' digital exhibition.
