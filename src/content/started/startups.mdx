# How I Got Started
## with Startups

I must say that the way of life and the meaning of life of running a startup began at home. My father has been a person who has managed to create engineering companies for the countryside and in my home there was always an air of entrepreneurship. However, my attachment to the subject is not directly linked by and for that. My desire and tireless energy that I put to this topic in every day of my life is related to a dream. A dream that was born from my creativity and my own ideas that added to a revealing personality and not condescending or obedient is that I became an entrepreneur.

The world of entrepreneurship is not for anyone, but for very few. Given the high level of frustration and permanent crisis that diadio takes is that not everyone supports it. In my case, finding myself in front of my own ideas that you could change the world motivated me enough to believe in myself and believe that everything was possible. With the passing of the years and the different experiences, I have been able to shape my character around the symptoms that occur when undertaking an undertaking and it is to this day that beyond success or failure I affirm that this is my life and it is life. that I choose every day.

While my first hint came from a job I did nudging charts and accidentally posting my first big experience as an entrepreneur came as a mobile software that boasted of being the world's first multitouch mouse whose history dates back to patenting a USPTO patent. in a project that was born conceptually as Roaming Keyboards and was capitalized on a product called Padkite. However, previously I had, without knowing it, a signal that came developing dynamic chats.


## [Dynamic Chats](#dynamic-chats)
#### First sign

It was the year 2005 and started working at a local statup comapany in Buenos Aires called <i>Arinware Intelligent technologies S.A.</i> as a Flash AS2 Developer. The statups produced software for call centers and communication comanies. My firts task was to develop an <i>E-learning Tool</i> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaya" target="_blank">Avaya</a> with very sophisticated animations of phones displays for training custommers and personnel. By that time the company was facing financial problems and I have been asked to take a look at some charts that the <i>Technovoz</i> callcenter system was not able to run due to unpaid chats licences. Bare in mind chats by that time where very expensive. So with some preliminar calculation and a series of test scripts I was able to write -in Flash- a basic like chart that drew a random line over an x and y axis. It was weird and old fashion type of scripting since object oriented came to ActionScript afterwords in AS3 Version so I had to figure out how to solve it via synchronic code, and I did.

I was nice. But nicer was after I got together with the .Net specialist Rodrigo Diaz and we started pushing dynamic data into it. It worked and was marvelous! The story is that I was able to develop all the suite charts including pie, bars and spider. I was amazed myself and helped the startup to avoid paying licences. However that was not what surprised me the most. It was that after I left that job I compiled all the charts and posted them on the internet on a page I used to show my work in interviews. I must have been two months after that when I was digging into the hosting server starts and found out the chats have been download used by southoands of people and all over the world.

Unfortunately I did not undertand the meaning of that until years later. If I would I could probably not be even writting this post and enjoing my revenue like <a href="https://www.fusioncharts.com" targer="_blank">FusionCharts</a> who started at that time with similar technology as I accomplished with my very own hands. This experience opened my mind in the senso of showing me that I could build products and sell them over the Internet.

Over the yeards. The two most important things I have to be greatfull about is to continue building my experience while engaging with real people.
