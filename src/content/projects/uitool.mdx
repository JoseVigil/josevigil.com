# [UiTool](#uitool)
### [user Interface Tool](#user-interface-tool)

<br/>

<a href="/projects/uitool" target="_blank">UiTool</a> is an all-in-one no-code tool developed by <a href="/projects/notimation" target="_blank">Notimation</a> to design marketing and communication pieces including Message Previews, PowerApps, Email Templates and Bots. As a resutl produces a format called SkinX wich means the “skin” plus the “X” of usability of a company. UiTool is a very user friendly web application.

### [Terminology](#terminology)

<br/>

UiTool has a set of its own terminologies that define concepts and functionalities. They are unique product definitions that are authentic and specific to your personality. Among others, these are the most important:

<br/>

##### [SkinX](#skinx)
The Skin of a company is an analogy to its brand design, color pallette, content and customization of the design of marketing and communication pieces including Message Previews, PowerApps, Email Templates and Bots. The format that UiTool produces is called SkinX wich means the “skin” plus the “X” of usability of a company.

<br/>

##### [Flake](#flake)
A Flake is the second concept that we define, the “flakes” found in a Skin divide it for the creation of PowerApps, Previews, Email templates and Bots.

<br/>

##### [PowerApp](#powerapp)
A PowerApp, abbreviated as PWA, is understood as a simple landing page customized with the brand of a company, and personalized with the variables of the user who receives said PWA (name, surname, other information) through a mass sending of SMS, WA or Emails.

<br/>

##### [Preview](#Preview)
Previews are a generator of images, also dynamic and customized with the user's data, which are previewed when sharing the link through Meta's <a href="https://ogp.me/" targe="_blank">Open Graph</a> protocol. A technology that is little exploited in the industry and that allows you to quickly capture the attention of a user by receiving an SMS or WA with a preview, with your own name or information. Unike in the market and yet not exploted as a marketing piece, the Preview has a great potential to introduce communication to the user inviting to visit the PowerApp.

<br/>

##### [Email](#email)
Emails are simple HTML templates that are processed for mass sending of a campaign, also allowing the injection of variables to personalize each email with the recipient's information.

<br/>

##### [Bot](#bot)
Bots. With Notimation's AI team we developed our own bot configuration standard with all the relevant information of a company (name, description, bot behavior, mission, permissions, restrictions, among others) to embed bots in a PWA (eventually in any type of site developed in Wordpress, React, other) and that they are able to answer questions about it. The bot configuration is used to feed language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4 or other Open Source models such as LLaMa or Bloom.

<br/>

## [Origin](#origin)

<br/>

Back in September 2020, while I was already doing business with <a href="/projects/notimation" target="_balnk">Notimation</a> I started working with some ideas about creating an application for designing and building enriched campaigns, now called Power Campaigns. I was eager to build a prototype to verify drag and drop use cases, generation of previews (Open Graph Protocol Images generated on top of shared links on social apps), landings and pages. Viewing templates in UiTrade. PWA testing, dynamic asset generation with Google Cloud and Lamda.
