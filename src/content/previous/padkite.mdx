### The first multitouch mobile mouse...shoot

<br/>

My first entrepreneur project was an incredible venture that cought the attention of an early mobile scene worldwide. It
was around early 2007 before the iPhone was launched and Android was in version 2.1 where I  was eager to start merging my both knowlerges and passions Technology and Design. A preliminar research and patent application <a href="/previous/roamingkeyboards" target="_target">Roaming Keyboards</a> (granted) lead the way to work with a virtual pointer or mouse for multitouch interfaces.

<br />

It was also clear by then (before the world population adopted cellphone touch screens) that cellphones where small and fingers where big considering the size of a computer pointer. Early adopters complained that touch screen cellphones were too tiny to use it with big fingers. We built the first mobile mouse for cellphones.

<br />

There was so much enthusiasm with mobile that I decided to do something about it.
Created my first LLC in the US and assembled an international team of outstanding people who
shared my vision and we build an incredible piece of software.

PadKite, was the name given to the first mobile cursor for Android that operated over a web
browser with the use of gestures. It was the mouse of touch screen and its performance was
incredible. Even got a great hype after I posted a thread at Hacker News, the best technology forum
for entrepreneurs in the US. The post was at the top of the day during one day and generated 20.000
downloads. This fact gave me great encouragement to move ahead with my career as an
entrepreneur and marked me for the rest of my career. Everything is possible if you are committed.

### [Hacker News](#hacker-news)

<br/>

<JDate data={frontmatter.dates['Hacker News']}/> Padkite was a true marvel of technology and its performance was incredible as well as its slogan, very disruptive. That's why one day I decided to share it with the great community of entrepreneurs at <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/' target='_blank'>YCombinator Hacker News</a>. I gave it the title <b><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2366954" target="_blank">"The first multitouch mobile mouse...shoot"</a></b> and I felt like I had to break the mold. A beautiful stir was created and the post was at the top of the list all day, March 11, 2011. This caused 20 thousand downloads of the apk from the website, which represented a true milestone for my personal history as an entrepreneur.
